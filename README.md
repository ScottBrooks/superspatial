### TODO

#### CLIENT
 - Spatial locator/receptionist client signin flow.
 - Load ship spritesheets
 - Send input to spatial
 - Render ships we get added.
 - Enter on start button = connect

#### SERVER
 - Spatial local start
 - Physics
 - Create entity for client when they connect
 - Multiworker

#### BOTH
 - Schema
 - Physics - Forward for forward thrust, backwards for backward thrust, left/right rotates ship.
           - Vector adjusted based off thrust.  Probably a real formula for this.  F=MA?
